# airbnb-clone-project
ALX-project

## Overview
This project is a backend-focused clone of Airbnb. It is designed to support key features such as user registration, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. The goal is to build a scalable, secure, and production-ready backend for a vacation rental platform.

## Project Goals
- Implement secure user authentication and profile management.
- Enable hosts to create, update, and manage property listings.
- Allow users to make and manage bookings.
- Process payments securely.
- Support user-generated reviews and ratings.
- Optimize data storage and retrieval using database strategies.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Django (Python)
- **API Development**: Django REST Framework, GraphQL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching & Queues**: Redis, Celery
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment Tools**: CI/CD Pipelines

## Team Roles
Below are the key team roles involved in building the Airbnb Clone backend:

### 🧠 Backend Developer
Responsible for designing and implementing the core logic of the application. This includes building RESTful and GraphQL APIs, integrating services (e.g., payment processors), and ensuring system performance and security.

### 🗄️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the database structure. Ensures efficient data modeling, indexing, backups, and optimizations for high-performance data access and reliability.

### 🛠️ DevOps Engineer
Handles the infrastructure and deployment pipeline. Sets up Docker containers, CI/CD workflows, monitors system performance, and ensures that the backend is scalable and secure in various environments (e.g., staging, production).

### 🧪 QA Engineer
Tests the functionality and reliability of the backend services. Writes and executes test cases, identifies bugs, verifies bug fixes, and ensures APIs meet performance and reliability standards.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

### 🧩 Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the core backend system, manage URL routing, handle requests/responses, and structure the app into reusable components.

### 🔗 Django REST Framework (DRF)
A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. It simplifies the process of creating CRUD operations and handling serialization, authentication, and permissions.

### 🔍 GraphQL
A query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need. It provides flexibility and efficiency, especially for frontend integrations.

### 🐘 PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source relational database used to store structured data such as users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.

### 🧵 Celery
An asynchronous task queue used for handling background tasks like sending notifications, processing payments, or sending confirmation emails.

### 🧠 Redis
An in-memory data store used for caching and managing Celery task queues, improving performance and reducing database load.

### 📦 Docker
Used to containerize the application for consistent development, testing, and deployment across all environments.

### 🔁 CI/CD Pipelines
Automated tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) used to run tests and deploy changes reliably and efficiently whenever code is pushed.
