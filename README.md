**Relationship**:  
- A review is written by a user for a specific property  
---
### 5. **Payment**
Represents a transaction made for a booking.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `booking_id`: Foreign key linking to the associated booking
- `amount`: Total amount paid
- `payment_method`: e.g., credit card, PayPal
- `status`: Payment status (e.g., paid, pending, failed)

**Relationship**:  
- A payment is linked to one booking  
- A booking may have one associated payment

## üß© Feature Breakdown

Core features of the Airbnb Clone backend and how each one contributes to delivering a seamless user experience.

### 1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, update their profiles, and manage their account settings. This feature is essential for authenticating users and tracking their activity across the platform.

### 2. Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes details such as title, location, price, and description, forming the core of the platform‚Äôs rental inventory.

### 3. Booking System
Allows users to book available properties by selecting check-in/check-out dates and submitting requests. It also supports booking management and conflict prevention through date validations.

### 4. Payment Processing
Facilitates secure payment transactions for confirmed bookings. It integrates with external payment providers and logs transaction details to ensure financial traceability.

### 5. Review System
Lets users leave ratings and written feedback for properties they have stayed at. This feature helps build trust among users and provides hosts with valuable insights.

### 6. API Documentation
All RESTful and GraphQL APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard. Clear documentation ensures easy integration for frontend developers and third-party services.

### 7. Database Optimization
Incorporates indexing, caching (via Redis), and asynchronous task handling (via Celery) to boost performance, especially as the platform scales.

## üîê API Security

To ensure the protection of sensitive user data, financial transactions, and system integrity, the following measures will be implemented across the application:

### 1. Authentication
All endpoints will be secured using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT). This ensures that only verified users can access protected resources, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

**Why it's important:**  
Protects user accounts and prevents identity theft or data breaches.

---

### 2. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented to define what actions users (e.g., guests vs. hosts) are allowed to perform. For example, only property owners should be able to edit their listings.

**Why it's important:**  
Prevents users from accessing or modifying resources they don‚Äôt own or shouldn‚Äôt interact with.

---

### 3. Rate Limiting & Throttling
APIs will enforce rate limits to prevent abuse such as brute-force attacks, spamming endpoints, or overloading the server.

**Why it's important:**  
Helps mitigate denial-of-service attacks and ensures fair use of system resources.

---

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to protect against SQL injection, XSS, and other common web vulnerabilities.

**Why it's important:**  
Ensures data integrity and protects the database from malicious input.

---

### 5. Secure Payment Integration
All payment processes will be handled through secure and compliant payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), ensuring encryption and transaction safety.

**Why it's important:**  
Protects financial data and ensures compliance with industry standards like PCI DSS.

---

### 6. HTTPS & Secure Headers
All communication with the API will occur over HTTPS, and responses will include secure HTTP headers (e.g., CORS, Content Security Policy).

**Why it's important:**  
Protects data in transit from being intercepted or manipulated.

---

### 7. Logging and Monitoring
Security-related events such as failed login attempts, suspicious activity, and system errors will be logged and monitored.

**Why it's important:**  
Allows for early detection of security threats and supports auditing and incident response.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** is a development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code. CI ensures that changes pushed to the repository are automatically tested, while CD ensures those changes can be deployed seamlessly and reliably to production.
