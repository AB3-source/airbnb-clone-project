# airbnb-clone-project
ALX-project

## Overview
This project is a backend-focused clone of Airbnb. It is designed to support key features such as user registration, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. The goal is to build a scalable, secure, and production-ready backend for a vacation rental platform.

## Project Goals
- Implement secure user authentication and profile management.
- Enable hosts to create, update, and manage property listings.
- Allow users to make and manage bookings.
- Process payments securely.
- Support user-generated reviews and ratings.
- Optimize data storage and retrieval using database strategies.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Django (Python)
- **API Development**: Django REST Framework, GraphQL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching & Queues**: Redis, Celery
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment Tools**: CI/CD Pipelines

## Team Roles
Below are the key team roles involved in building the Airbnb Clone backend:

### üß† Backend Developer
Responsible for designing and implementing the core logic of the application. This includes building RESTful and GraphQL APIs, integrating services (e.g., payment processors), and ensuring system performance and security.

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the database structure. Ensures efficient data modeling, indexing, backups, and optimizations for high-performance data access and reliability.

### üõ†Ô∏è DevOps Engineer
Handles the infrastructure and deployment pipeline. Sets up Docker containers, CI/CD workflows, monitors system performance, and ensures that the backend is scalable and secure in various environments (e.g., staging, production).

### üß™ QA Engineer
Tests the functionality and reliability of the backend services. Writes and executes test cases, identifies bugs, verifies bug fixes, and ensures APIs meet performance and reliability standards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

### üß© Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the core backend system, manage URL routing, handle requests/responses, and structure the app into reusable components.

### üîó Django REST Framework (DRF)
A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. It simplifies the process of creating CRUD operations and handling serialization, authentication, and permissions.

### üîç GraphQL
A query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need. It provides flexibility and efficiency, especially for frontend integrations.

### üêò PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source relational database used to store structured data such as users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.

### üßµ Celery
An asynchronous task queue used for handling background tasks like sending notifications, processing payments, or sending confirmation emails.

### üß† Redis
An in-memory data store used for caching and managing Celery task queues, improving performance and reducing database load.

### üì¶ Docker
Used to containerize the application for consistent development, testing, and deployment across all environments.

### üîÅ CI/CD Pipelines
Automated tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) used to run tests and deploy changes reliably and efficiently whenever code is pushed.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

Below is a high-level overview of entities, their important fields, and their relationships.

### 1. **User**
Represents guests and hosts using the platform.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: Used for login and communication
- `password`: Hashed password
- `is_host`: Boolean to indicate if the user can list properties

**Relationship**:  
- A user can create multiple properties (if they are a host)  
- A user can make multiple bookings and write multiple reviews  
---
### 2. **Property**
Represents a rental listing created by a host.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `title`: Name or description of the property
- `location`: City or address of the property
- `price_per_night`: Cost of staying per night
- `host_id`: Foreign key linking to the user who owns the property

**Relationship**:  
- A property belongs to one host (user)  
- A property can have multiple bookings and reviews  
---
### 3. **Booking**
Represents a reservation made by a user for a property.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key linking to the booking user
- `property_id`: Foreign key linking to the booked property
- `check_in`: Start date of the booking
- `check_out`: End date of the booking

**Relationship**:  
- A booking is made by one user for one property  
- Each booking can be linked to a payment  
---
### 4. **Review**
Represents user feedback on a property.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key linking to the reviewer
- `property_id`: Foreign key linking to the reviewed property
- `rating`: Numerical score (e.g., 1‚Äì5)
- `comment`: Textual review

**Relationship**:  
- A review is written by a user for a specific property  
---
### 5. **Payment**
Represents a transaction made for a booking.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `booking_id`: Foreign key linking to the associated booking
- `amount`: Total amount paid
- `payment_method`: e.g., credit card, PayPal
- `status`: Payment status (e.g., paid, pending, failed)

**Relationship**:  
- A payment is linked to one booking  
- A booking may have one associated payment

## üß© Feature Breakdown

Core features of the Airbnb Clone backend and how each one contributes to delivering a seamless user experience.

### 1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, update their profiles, and manage their account settings. This feature is essential for authenticating users and tracking their activity across the platform.

### 2. Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each property includes details such as title, location, price, and description, forming the core of the platform‚Äôs rental inventory.

### 3. Booking System
Allows users to book available properties by selecting check-in/check-out dates and submitting requests. It also supports booking management and conflict prevention through date validations.

### 4. Payment Processing
Facilitates secure payment transactions for confirmed bookings. It integrates with external payment providers and logs transaction details to ensure financial traceability.

### 5. Review System
Lets users leave ratings and written feedback for properties they have stayed at. This feature helps build trust among users and provides hosts with valuable insights.

### 6. API Documentation
All RESTful and GraphQL APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard. Clear documentation ensures easy integration for frontend developers and third-party services.

### 7. Database Optimization
Incorporates indexing, caching (via Redis), and asynchronous task handling (via Celery) to boost performance, especially as the platform scales.
